Welcome to openpilot
======

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driving agent. Currently, it performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) for selected Honda, Toyota, Acura, Lexus, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Kia. It's about on par with Tesla Autopilot and GM Super Cruise, and better than [all other manufacturers](http://www.thedrive.com/tech/5707/the-war-for-autonomous-driving-part-iii-us-vs-germany-vs-japan).

The openpilot codebase has been written to be concise and to enable rapid prototyping. We look forward to your contributions - improving real vehicle automation has never been easier.
